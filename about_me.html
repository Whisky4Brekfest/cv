    <h1>A little bit about me...</h1>
    <p>My name is Ronie and I am 31 years old. I live in Herriman, UT with my lovely wife, adorable 1 year old daughter and
      our dog Mimies. After working in a front facing customer support role at eBay for last 4+ years, I feel it's time to
      finally break into the tech field. I've always had a passion for technology and web development in general and I am
      looking forward to learning as much I can from Angela's course.</p>
